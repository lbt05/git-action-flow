Reusable Workflows maintained by OpenBayes

## Runners

- `self-hosted`: 8 GB 2 cores servers from UCloud. Better connectivity to UCloud UHub Docker registry. Use these runners to build and push container images.
- `ubuntu-latest`: GitHub Actions official runners. Better overall networking connectivity. Slightly slower than `self-hosted`. Use these runners to test and build projects.
